### Assignment title :

Property binding an <h2> DOM element:

- Property binding is a one-way binding from the data-source (the component) to the view (the template) specifically to the DOM (while attribuite binding is also from data-source to view but in this case the view is the HTML attribute rendered by the browser).

### Assignment instructions :

- In this assignment you will use attribute binding to two (of four) <h1> element DOM properties.
- Following are 4 <h> element DOM properties, the first two will be in the assignment:
- - className
- - textContent
- - innerHTML
- - tagName

---

- Create a component for this page in a 'features' folder.

---

- The 'textContent' property:
- For the value of 'textContent' create an input box.
- Whatever the user types in the input box will be transfered to the DOM's <h> tag 'textContent' property.
- - The UI should look something like this :
-

---

- The 'className' attribute:
- For the value of 'class' attribute create 2 buttons:
- - class value can be : " | my-class-1 | my-class-2 "
- - On every click the DOM property className will change.
- - The UI should look something like this :
-

---

- FYI:
- - These 'textContent' & 'className' & are Properties of DOM's mirroring of the <h> element.
- - They are different then the HTML attributes of the <h> element.
- -
- - This assignment uses the <h> element because the names of the HTML attribute and DOM properties are different. That is in contrast to the <img> element where the HTML attributes and DOM properies have exacty same names which is confusing when learning the difference between attribute & property binding.

### Page design

- The page displays a 2 div blocks with a border surrounding them.
- Here is an example screen shot of the page to create:
