### User experience
- The message is : "This is my color changing message"
- - The message needs to be in font-size: large;
-
- Under the message display 4 buttons RED, GREEN, BLUE & RESET
-
- When clicking on each of the color buttons the color toggles between the default to the color.
- - For example clicking on GREEN will toggle between grren and default.
-
- When clicking on the RESET button then color resets to default.
- - After reset the color buttons need to return to their default state (not remember their last state)

### Assignment hint :
- Use the 'ngClass' directive.
- - ngClass is suitable for handling multiple classes on a condition
- - Also FYI, it is usefull when the addition/removal of classes is dependent on data that is dynamically and frequently changing.
