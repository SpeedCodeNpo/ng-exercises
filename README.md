### Assignment instructions :

- Create a component in a 'features' folder.pure" property to 'false' the filter will react to added students.
- Use the data from the pre-made 'DoginfoService' see path : /app/core/doginfo.service.ts
- See illustration above for styling the UI.

### User experience :
- See screenshots above.
  
### Hint :
- The solution has two implementations, the second one uses ngForOf which is a longer expression than *ngFor.
- Actually *ngFor is a wrapper over ngForOf, it as created for more human readble and less code to write.
