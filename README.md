### Assignment title :

Create a piping playground.

### Page design

- The page displays a list of div blocks, each dedicated to its own pipe implementation
- Here is an example screen shot of the page to create:

### User experience :

Here is the user flow:
(1) The user can scroll veritcaly to any div block.
(2) In each block the user can use the input boxes to type in info and see the pipe convert the info. 

### Assignment hint :
- Use the relavent piping for each div-block.
- Use \*ngFor to display the div blocks in a column.
