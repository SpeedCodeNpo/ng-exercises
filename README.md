### Assignment title :

### User experience
- The first message is : "This is message one"
- Under the message a button "CHANGE STYLE"
- When clicking the button the style changes from default to this style:
- - color: purple; and font-size: xx-large;
-_______
- The second message is : "This is message two"
- - The message needs to be in font-size: large;
-
- Under the message display 4 buttons RED, GREEN, BLUE & RESET
-
- When clicking on each of the color buttons the color toggles between the default to the color.
- - For example clicking on GREEN will toggle between grren and default.
-
- When clicking on the RESET button then color resets to default.
- - After reset the color buttons need to return to their default state (not remember their last state)

### Assignment hint :

- For the first message use class binding syntax.
- - It is the most suitable for handling a single class.
- The second way is to use ngClass directive.
- - ngClass is more suitable for handling multiple classes on a condition, and when the addition or removal of classes is dependent on data that is dynamically and frequently changing.
