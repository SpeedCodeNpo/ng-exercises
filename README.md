### User experience
- The first message is : "This is message one"
- Under the message a button "CHANGE STYLE"
- When clicking the button the style changes so that :
- - The color is purple
- - The font-size is xx-large
-
- The second message is : "This is message two"
- Under the message a button "CHANGE STYLE 2"
- When clicking the button the style changes so that :
- - The color is blue
- - The font-size is x-small

### Assignment hint :

- The first way is to use the class binding syntax.
- - This way is best suiyted for handling a single class.
- The second way is to use ngClass.
- - [ngClass] is more usefull for cases of handlig multiple classes on a condition and also when the class add/remove is dependent on data that is dynamically and  frequenty changing.
